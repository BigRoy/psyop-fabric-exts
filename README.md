## Scatter

Scatter is an extension that does even point scattering on meshes and dart throwing. 

Dart throwing is done using dart sizers and dart filterers, both of which are replacable in the system. For instance, there is a sizer that starts with large darts, and ends with small darts, and a weight map filter to use a weight map to define a maximum sized point in an area. 

Please see /scatter/test/scatterTest.kl for some code examples.
